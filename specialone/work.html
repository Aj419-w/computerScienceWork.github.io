  <h2 id = "alpha">We build and operate virtual machines</h2>

  <div id= "bravo">
    we can build virtual machines to function for operating systems that run on your host OS.
      The virtualised OS is commonly referred to as a guest as is managed by software called a <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor">Hypervisor</a> .
      <br>
      <br>
    
  
    The hypervisor helps you allocate resources like CPU, Memory and disk space on your “guest”
    <br>
    Most popular hypervisor we can offer: <ol>
      <li>Hyper V</li>
      <li>Virtualbox</li>
      <li>VMware</li>
      <li>KVM</li>
    </ol>
    <br>

    The term “cloud” usually means thousands of VMs running on specialised hypervisors on someone else’s server farm in a data centre somewhere else.
    <br>
    Virtual machines allow you to become platform agnostic, meaning you are not limited by particular operating system and tools available for it

  <h2 id = "alpha">The command line </h2>

  <div id = "bravo">
    The command line interface commonly referred to as a shell is arguably the best way to interact with an Operating system<br> The command line gives you access to the lowest level access to software functionality that comes with an operating system<br> Automating your workflow by learning the command line will save you lots of time while working on projects<br> which is why when you spend your money with us we work fast and efficently to deliver projects on time to the highest standard

  <h2 id = "alpha">
    Networking 
  </h2>

  <div id = "bravo">
    Its understanding how devices interact with each other and how data gets to point A to B <br> A good understanding in networking will make you and expert troubleshooter. There are 2 conceptual models that govern networking: TCP/IP and OSI <br>
    TCP/IP is older than OSI and has 4 layers: <ol>
      <li>Network access</li>
      <li>Internet</li>
      <li>transport</li>
      <li>Application</li>
      <br>
      OSI has been further updated and has 7 layers: <ol>
        <li>Physical</li>
        <li>Data link</li>
        <li>Network</li>
        <li>transport</li>
        <li>Session</li>
        <li>Presentation</li>
        <li>Application</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      Our engineers are comfortable working with both TCP and OSI so you van be sure we can make a fully functioning OS for all your needs.
